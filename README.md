# Tamagotchi
Project 0

Welcome to a future post apocalyptic world in which our only chance of survival is the genetical development of a new breed of creatures design to stave off the aggresive species that evolved at a very alarming pace. 

Your job will be to take care of the small creature until it is mature and strong enough to be able to survive it's future encounters.

Your task while sensitive will be aided by the wonders of nanotechnology. The tamagotchi's body is flooded with nanobots that monitor all the vital aspects. They will display on the left hand side under the familiar health bar forms. Watch those closely!

Also some bots were tasked with keeping track of it's evolution so we will know exactly when the creature is ready to be collected. We used those bots to display on the right hand side a timer that will tell you how long has passed and how old the tamagotchi is. 

In order to better manage the Tamagotchi we created a device to aid you. We know that the creature can be very demanding and manually handling it could get overwhelming. We supplied you with bots to handle all of that for you. You just need to give them instructions. These commands will be displayed conveniently on the lower side of the screen. Not even you can mess that up.

Now good luck, Agent!
